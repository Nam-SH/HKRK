    "Given `n` names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each `name` queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for `name` is not found, print Not found instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap val structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Input Format`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains an integer, `n`, denoting the number of entries in the phone book. \n",
    "Each of the `n` subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of `2` space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an `8`-digit phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `n` lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a `name` to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Output Format`\n",
    "\n",
    "On a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full `name` and `PhoneNumber` in the format name=phoneNumber.\n",
